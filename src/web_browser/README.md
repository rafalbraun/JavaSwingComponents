### Java Web Browser

This project is rudimentary web browser, implemented using only standard java tools. It handles only limited subset of css and no javascript is enabled, so only older websited will be presented as expected. It does however show pictures and provide clickable links.

Examples of websites that are handled well enough:
- https://news.ycombinator.com/
